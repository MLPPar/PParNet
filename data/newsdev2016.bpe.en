Norway &apos;s rak@@ fis@@ k : is this the world &apos;s smel@@ liest fish ?
Norway &apos;s five million people enjoy one of the highest standards of living , not just in Europe , but in the world .
could the secret of the country &apos;s success be connected to the local appetite for some exce@@ ed@@ ingly smel@@ ly fish ?
take a selection of over @-@ ripe che@@ es@@ es .
place them in the midst of a pile of dirty , w@@ et soccer kit .
leave for a week .
now you have the n@@ ose @-@ num@@ bing smell of rak@@ fis@@ k , one of the great Norwegian De@@ lic@@ acies .
I am in the small town of F@@ ag@@ er@@ nes , about three hours from Oslo .
there is snow , spectacular scenery - and that od@@ our , ever present , hangs in the air .
Rak@@ fis@@ k is trout sprinkled with salt and fer@@ mented in water for - depending on how smel@@ ly you like your fish - up to a year .
as the dark sets in and the weather turns cold , Norwe@@ gi@@ ans flock to a festival here in F@@ ag@@ er@@ nes devoted to this most , well , cap@@ tiv@@ ating of foods .
&quot; you eat it raw , and then swallow a glass of aqu@@ av@@ it , &quot; says Hav@@ ard Hal@@ var@@ sen , full @-@ time local firefighter but also the so @-@ called &quot; Rak@@ fis@@ k General , &quot; in charge of running the festival .
all around us people are eating little c@@ ub@@ es of the fish and knocking back quantities of drink .
&quot; some people like the aqu@@ av@@ it more than the rak@@ fis@@ k , &quot; says Hav@@ ard .
the drink can kill the smell .
I try a few pieces .
if you can avoid passing it under your n@@ ose , it is not bad - not unlike a sli@@ ce of sus@@ hi that has been on rather a long bus journey .
Rak@@ fis@@ k is a product of very different , poverty @-@ stricken times in Norway when , pre @-@ refriger@@ ation , fish was so@@ aked in air@@ tight barrels of water and salt in autumn .
then in the depths of winter , well and truly fer@@ mented , it is taken out and - no doubt with the senses knocked out by alcohol - eaten .
only a generation ago , thousands of Norwe@@ gi@@ ans were forced to leave their country in search of work , emig@@ rating mainly to the US .
now the population is expanding fast - more than 13 % are immigrants , attracted by plentiful jobs , high wages and a comprehensive care system .
people from Sweden , the old rival and not so long ago far richer than Norway , stream in to work .
Rak@@ fis@@ k is seen as signi@@ fying something important , a vital if rather smel@@ ly part of Norway &apos;s past .
it is among the more expensive dishes you can buy .
but then everything is expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich knock you back Â£ 9 ( $ 14 ) each .
Norway does not often make it on to the global news agenda - and most seem to like it that way .
people here are still lo@@ ath to mention by name Anders Breivik , the right @-@ wing , racist extremist who gunned down and killed 77 men , women and children last year .
instead , the shootings are referred to as &quot; the July the 22nd incident . &quot;
Norwe@@ gi@@ ans find it very difficult to believe that in their peace @-@ loving country one of their own was capable of such brutality and murder .
the growth since the early 1970s of one of the world &apos;s biggest oil and gas industries lies behind much of Norway &apos;s present @-@ day wealth .
&quot; but oil is not the only reason we are doing so well , &quot; says Anna our wa@@ it@@ ress , handing round tr@@ ays of maturing rak@@ fis@@ k and , with her long bl@@ ond hair and start@@ l@@ ingly blue eyes , the image of Nordic well @-@ being .
we are a - how you say - prudent people .
her English , like that of most people here , is f@@ lawless .
we are not very show@@ y , we do not like osten@@ tation .
Norway has handled its oil wealth very carefully - all but a small percentage of money from the industry is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations .
when everyone else was throwing around money they did not have , in the years leading up to the global financial crash , Norway kept its pur@@ se strings tigh@@ tly bound .
&quot; as long as we can ski in winter and go hi@@ king in summer we are happy , &quot; says Anna .
&quot; and eat rak@@ fis@@ k , &quot; she adds with a car@@ ef@@ ree laugh .
I stand in the snow and queue for something to eat - I have had enough rak@@ fis@@ k .
now an el@@ k burger is certainly something different and rather suc@@ cul@@ ent to the taste .
but in the evening , it is more of that smel@@ ly fish .
the hotel I am staying in is one of a number of venues hosting a rak@@ fis@@ k dinner where guests vote on the best - or perhaps the most nas@@ ally challenging - fish .
there is a live TV link up to a comp@@ ere in a bow tie surrounded by plates of rak@@ fis@@ k .
it is like the Eurovision song contest .
&quot; what score do you have for the best fish up there in the mountains Th@@ or @-@ Ju@@ er@@ gen ? &quot;
&quot; here are our points , Hav@@ ard . &quot;
there is cl@@ apping , la@@ ughter .
a man falls off his chair , perhaps overcome with aqu@@ av@@ it .
or maybe it is the fu@@ mes from all that fish .
Mexico &apos;s Enri@@ que Pena Ni@@ eto faces tough start
as Mexico &apos;s incoming President Enri@@ que Pena Ni@@ eto prepares to take office , the BBC &apos;s Will Grant looks at the challenges facing him and the mixed expectations of his population .
traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad at present .
a congested city at the best of times , a ring of steel has been erected since Monday cutting off several key routes into the capital and causing chaos on the roads .
the aim , however , wasn &apos;t to stop commu@@ ters getting to work but prevent protesters from reaching parliament .
on Saturday , Mexico &apos;s new president Enri@@ que Pena Ni@@ eto will receive the presidential s@@ ash and take over the running of the nation .
he faces a complicated task .
Mexico has been performing well economically under the outgoing administration of Felipe Cal@@ der@@ on , but the country is in the grip of a drug war , which has already claimed an estimated 60,000 lives in six years .
&quot; my government has a great commitment to the Mexican people to reduce the violence , &quot; Mr Pena Ni@@ eto told US President Barack Obama in the Oval Office earlier this week .
I will be proposing a new security strategy which will allow us to achieve that aim .
before rub@@ bing shoulders with the US president , Mr Pena Ni@@ eto &apos;s previous political experience was as governor of his home state , the State of Mexico .
a popul@@ ous , sprawling state surrounding the capital , opinions about the new leader are divided in his old st@@ om@@ ping ground .
a straightforward man
in the bu@@ col@@ ic town of Val@@ le del Bra@@ vo , for example , he is remembered fon@@ dly .
residents credit him with boosting tourism in the resort and building infrastructure .
to reach the town you can drive along one of Mr Pena Ni@@ eto &apos;s new motorways , a vast improvement on the cracked and bumpy roads it replaced .
pla@@ ques bearing his name also hang outside a modern sports centre and an impressive interactive museum about climate change .
&quot; we are looking to him to bring about real and lasting change , &quot; says friend and political ally Gabriel Ol@@ vera Her@@ n@@ andez , a state Congressman for Mr Pena Ni@@ eto &apos;s party , the PR@@ I .
particularly in terms of security and the economy , we &apos;re hoping for an interesting and true change which our country so badly needs .
after an un@@ broken 81 years in power , the PR@@ I was ousted in 2000 by Vic@@ ente Fox .
Congressman Ol@@ vera admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los P@@ inos , there is much expectation within the party about Enri@@ que Pena Ni@@ eto .
and he rejects the opposition &apos;s characterisation of the new president as lacking substance .
he &apos;s a very straightforward man , very committed with an excellent vision of the country .
he &apos;s an excellent statesman and , above all , he &apos;s someone who knows how to listen .
but on the other side of the state , that is not the impression many people have of their former governor .
in Nez@@ ahu@@ alco@@ y@@ ot@@ l , also known as Ci@@ u@@ dad Neza , the contrast with the co@@ bbled streets of Val@@ le del Bra@@ vo couldn &apos;t be sharper .
tucked away under motorway fl@@ y@@ overs , it is in many ways a suburb of Mexico City itself .
and the problems in the municipality are also gr@@ it@@ ty and urban .
earlier this year , the military was called in to help tackle the drug gangs operating in the neighbourhoods , and violence against women is particularly acute .
on a pat@@ ch of waste@@ land by a vast land@@ fill site , the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been dumped over the past two years alone .
more than 1,000 women were killed in Mexico State while Mr Pena Ni@@ eto was governor , a rate much higher than in the notoriously violent city of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z - a place synonymous with the murder of innocent women .
Mr Pena Ni@@ eto &apos;s critics say , at best , he failed to adequately address the problem of fem@@ ic@@ ide while he was in office .
at worst , they accuse his administration of turning a blind eye .
in a concrete home typical of the run@@ down neighbourhood , Ir@@ in@@ ea Bu@@ endi@@ a struggles to fight back the tears as she shows me photos of her late daughter , Mariana Luna .
according to the official version of events , Mariana committed suicide in 2010 .
however her family believes she was murdered by her partner .
&quot; when I arrived at her house it seemed her body had been washed , &quot; Sen@@ ora Bu@@ endi@@ a recalls .
there were signs she &apos;d been beaten , and ri@@ gor mor@@ tis had already set in .
as her mother recounts the story , a picture of Mariana looks down from the walls , next to a cross bearing a single word : justice .
however , that is exactly what the family say they have been denied .
the state authorities have treated me like I &apos;m an old gos@@ sip , a trouble @-@ maker , a wh@@ iner .
what they want is that one simply accepts what they say and shuts up .
&quot; but that can &apos;t be right when there were so many irregularities and omissions , &quot; she says .
as President Pena Ni@@ eto receives the s@@ ash on Saturday , it comes with a heavy responsibility .
tens of thousands of families have been affected by violent crime in Mexico over the past six years and the new president has promised to make them a priority during his time in office .
&quot; I hope he &apos;s the same kind of president as he was a governor , &quot; says PR@@ I Congressman Ol@@ vera in Val@@ le del Bra@@ vo .
that , however , is exactly what victims &apos; families in Ci@@ u@@ dad Neza most fear .
Bradley manning didn &apos;t complain about mistreatment , prosecutors contend
prosecutors try to counter Bradley manning &apos;s claims of abuse in con@@ fin@@ ement
the hearing focuses on manning &apos;s time in the military Bri@@ g at Qu@@ anti@@ co , Virginia
defense wants case dismissed on grounds that manning &apos;s con@@ fin@@ ement was harsh
the Army private is accused of stealing thousands of classified documents
prosecutors tried to establish Friday that Army private Bradley manning -- charged in the largest leak of classified material in U@@ .S. history -- missed multiple opportunities to complain about the mistreatment he &apos;s alleging he suffered in military custody .
while cross @-@ examining manning at a pre @-@ trial hearing at FT . Me@@ ade , Mar@@ yland , prosecutor Maj@@ . Ash@@ den Fe@@ in asserted that records of weekly visits manning had with unit officers during nine months of detention at Qu@@ anti@@ co , Virginia , show no complaints about his treatment .
the cross @-@ examination -- during a hearing on a defense motion to have manning &apos;s case dismissed on grounds that his con@@ fin@@ ement has been harsh and has amounted to enough punishment -- came a day after manning testified that he had considered suicide while in custody .
the Army intelligence analyst , arrested in June 2010 , is accused of stealing thousands of classified documents while serving in Iraq .
the material was then published online by WikiLeaks .
WikiLeaks has never confirmed that manning was the source of its information .
in Friday &apos;s hearing , Fe@@ in reviewed with manning the forms that officers filled out after meeting with manning during his detention at Qu@@ anti@@ co &apos;s Bri@@ g , where he was held under a heightened con@@ fin@@ ement status from July 2010 to April 2011 .
officers would ask manning questions and write down his responses .
when Fe@@ in asked about the forms Friday , manning acknowledged that he rated treatment by his guards as &quot; excellent &quot; and treatment by the facility overall as &quot; very professional . &quot;
the forms show no complaints of mistreatment , even though the officers asked manning directly about his treatment , Fe@@ in contended .
manning responded that he would verbally express concern about issues and that the visiting officers would talk through the concerns and indicate that they would be addressed , but they didn &apos;t record the issues .
&quot; they would write down &apos; no issues &apos; ( after discussing the concerns ) , and it didn &apos;t necessarily mean I didn &apos;t bring something up , &quot; manning said .
the judge , Army Col@@ . Denise L@@ ind , also asked manning why he didn &apos;t complain about his treatment during a January 2011 meeting with a board examining the suic@@ id@@ al thoughts he expressed in a form months earlier .
manning replied that his intention during that meeting was to get his &quot; prevention of injury &quot; status downgraded .
the military said they put him on this restrictive status -- a step below suicide watch -- for his protection and the safety of others .
&quot; I wanted staff to know I was fine , and ( I wanted to ) get off the PO@@ I status ... to enjoy an increased quality of life from my viewpoint , &quot; manning said .
manning testified Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait , where he was held for nearly two months before being transferred to the Bri@@ g at Marine Base Qu@@ anti@@ co in Virginia in July 2010 .
he said he contempla@@ ted suicide in Kuwait and once passed out there due to the heat .
he said not being allowed to know what was happening to him or in the outside world was dist@@ ressing .
&quot; my world just shrink to Camp A@@ raf@@ jon , to that c@@ age , &quot; manning said Thursday .
I thought I was going to die in that c@@ age .
once at Qu@@ anti@@ co , manning said , he spend most days in a small cell -- at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours -- with no company .
manning said he was allowed only a mat@@ tress , blanket , f@@ lip @-@ fl@@ ops , some clothes and his glasses .
he said he tried to keep moving , because sleeping during the day or even lying down was against the rules .
manning said he always slept with light from outside his cell in his eyes .
if guards could not see his face when he rolled over at night , he said they would wake him to roll back over .
manning &apos;s lawyer filed a formal objection to manning &apos;s treatment in January 2011 .
manning was moved to the military prison at Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth , Kan@@ sas , in April 2011 .
also Friday , the judge asked manning about an allegation that he made in Thursday &apos;s testimony -- that after being forced to sleep nak@@ ed one night in his Qu@@ anti@@ co cell , he was forced to stand nak@@ ed in front of guards and other inmates during a morning head count .
manning had testified that he was never given a chance to cover himself with his blanket during the head count .
under questioning from the judge Friday , manning said that he in@@ ferred from his guard &apos;s order that he should drop a blanket that could have covered him , but he acknowledged that no one had ordered him to drop it .
manning testified Thursday that he was forced to sleep nak@@ ed the previous night because of his attempt to show an officer that he wasn &apos;t a danger to himself .
manning said that he told the officer that he could have used the wa@@ ist@@ band of his under@@ wear or his f@@ lip @-@ fl@@ ops to hurt himself but hadn &apos;t done so .
that night , manning testified , his under@@ wear , f@@ lip @-@ fl@@ ops and glasses were removed from his cell .
his lawyers hope the judge will at least take his experiences during con@@ fin@@ ement into account and sharply reduce his sentence should he be convicted at his court @-@ martial , which is expected to begin early next year .
the defense has said it plans to have manning plead guilty to lesser offen@@ ses and fight other charges as being too extreme .
the hearing is scheduled to resume this weekend , with prosecutors expected to argue that the detention conditions were warranted .
the Pentagon has maintained that manning was held in accordance with rules governing all maximum @-@ custody detainees at Qu@@ anti@@ co .
counts against manning include aiding the enemy , wrong@@ fully causing intelligence to be published on the Internet , transmitting national defense information and theft of public property or records .
if he &apos;s convicted on all counts , he could face a life sentence .
my Mexican @-@ American identity crisis
he says many were forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities there
Mex@@ ic@@ ans tend to fault those who left ; they remind Mex@@ ic@@ ans of hard times , he says
Nav@@ ar@@ rette says Mexican @-@ Americans are caught between two worlds
on a recent trip to Mexico City , I had barely made my way down the con@@ course and arrived at the immigration processing area when I got st@@ um@@ ped .
signs pointed the way to two lines : one for &quot; Mex@@ ic@@ anos &quot; ( &quot; Mex@@ ic@@ ans &quot; ) , another for &quot; Ex@@ tran@@ jer@@ os &quot; ( &quot; Foreigners . &quot; )
I stood there for a few seconds , unsure of where to go .
growing up in Central California , I had been called a &quot; Mexican &quot; my entire life .
it &apos;s ethnic shor@@ thand in the same way that my friends in Boston refer to themselves as &quot; Irish &quot; or my friends in New York describe themselves as &quot; Italian . &quot;
later , I settled on &quot; Mexican @-@ American . &quot;
but , this was Mexico .
and , in the homeland of my grandfather , there was no need for shor@@ thand or hy@@ ph@@ ens .
I was simply an American .
I speak Spanish , good enough to handle either end of an interview in that language .
but I don &apos;t have the vocabulary of a native , and I can &apos;t shake my American ac@@ cent .
so I took my U@@ .S. passport and got in the line for Ex@@ tran@@ jer@@ os .
I thought about that moment this week when Mexican president @-@ elect Enri@@ que Pena Ni@@ eto visited the White House to meet with President Obama .
on the agenda , as usual , when the leaders of these two countries meet : immigration , drugs and trade .
Pena Ni@@ eto was also eager to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy , which is one reason that Mex@@ ic@@ ans are now just as likely to stay in Mexico as venture to the United States .
he wants to partner with the United States and Canada , and create a European Union @-@ style trading bloc in North America .
and Pena Ni@@ eto vowed to continue Mexico &apos;s war against the drug cartels , even though he offered no specifics .
for Mexico , the relationship with the United States is complicated and filled with hard feelings .
most Americans probably never give a thought to the fact that , in 18@@ 48 , the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to sign over half their territory at the point of rifle .
but for Mex@@ ic@@ ans , who think in terms of centuries , not minutes , the reminders are everywhere .
so the minute that a U@@ .S. official says anything the least bit critical of Mexico , you start hearing -- in the Mexican press , and among the elites -- complaints about how the Americans are encro@@ aching upon their neigh@@ bor &apos;s sovereignty .
and the children of Mon@@ tez@@ uma go on the war@@ path .
and yet , for Mexico , the really challenging relationship is with the more than 35 million Mexican @-@ Americans living in the United States .
you want to talk about hard feelings ?
there is plenty .
Mexico has winners and losers , people for whom the country provides opportunities and others for whom it doesn &apos;t .
the only reason you have so many people of Mexican ances@@ try living in cities like Los Angeles , Las Vegas , Phoenix , Den@@ ver or San Antonio is because , at some point in our family tree , there was a person , maybe a parent or grand@@ parent , who was shut out from opportunity in Mexico and had to go north .
and more often than not , that person fit a profile -- dark skin , little education , from a poor village , etc .
we &apos;re their offspring , and we &apos;re loyal to them .
not Mexico .
and even though we may now be living the American Dream , having gone to good schools and taken good jobs , we can never lose sight of the fact that it &apos;s the American Dream we &apos;re living , and not the Mexican one .
our identity might sometimes be f@@ uz@@ zy , but our loyalty is clear .
it &apos;s to the United States .
besides , we &apos;re aware that many of the elite Mex@@ ic@@ ans in the ruling class don &apos;t like us .
the feeling is mutual .
they see us as a reminder of a humiliating defeat and look down on us as infer@@ ior stock that isn &apos;t sufficiently Mexican .
our Spanish will never be good enough , our ties to Mexico never strong enough .
our existence is , as they see it , all about failure .
if our families hadn &apos;t failed in Mexico , they wouldn &apos;t have left .
and we wouldn &apos;t now find ourselves trapped behind the sil@@ k cur@@ tain , living well in the United States but lost souls nonetheless .
my wife , who was born in Gu@@ adal@@ aj@@ ara and came to the United States legally as a child , reminds me that there is friction between Mex@@ ic@@ ans and Mexican @-@ Americans because Mex@@ ic@@ ans have a fir@@ mer gras@@ p of who they are and Mexican @-@ Americans res@@ ent that .
while she &apos;s a U@@ .S. citizen , she sees herself as a part of two countries .
meanwhile , many Mexican @-@ Americans I know don &apos;t feel like they &apos;re a part of either .
we love listening to the Mexican band , Los Ti@@ g@@ res del Nor@@ te , but also to Bruce Spr@@ ing@@ ste@@ en .
you get the best of both worlds , but you &apos;re rooted in neither .
in Mexico , we &apos;re seen as Americans .
and in the United States , we &apos;re considered Mexican .
now , to complicate the relationship even further , as I learned during my trip , some Mexican leaders and parts of the intel@@ li@@ gen@@ t@@ sia want to re@@ connect with the Diaspora .
they want to put Mexican @-@ Americans to work as makeshift &quot; ambassadors &quot; for Mexico , representing its interest in the United States .
we would tell our fellow Americans what a great country this is to visit and pressure political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico .
ye@@ ah .
that &apos;s not going to happen .
too many hard feelings .
and , with income inequality and rampant corruption and drug violence , many of us are not so sure that it is a great country .
I &apos;m afraid you &apos;re on your own , am@@ ig@@ os .
that &apos;s fair .
if at least some Mex@@ ic@@ ans aren &apos;t yet ready to forgive the United States for how it treated Mexico a century and a half ago , then they have to accept the fact that some Mexican @-@ Americans still hold a gru@@ dge for how their family members were treated much more recently than that .
H@@ m@@ mm .
maybe we &apos;re more &quot; Mexican &quot; than I thought .
old battles , new Middle East
the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could yet be an unlikely foundation for peace
can there ever be a lasting peace between Ara@@ bs and Jews in the Middle East ?
another round of bloodshed suggests that any such hope is vain .
amid the usual fu@@ tile arguments over who started it , scores of buildings have been reduced to rubble ; more than 140 Palestinians , most of them civilians , and six Israelis have been killed ; and , for the first time , missiles from Gaza have landed near Tel Aviv , Israel &apos;s metropolis , and the holy city of Jerusalem .
but though the Israelis and Palestinians seem stuck in their ancient conflict , all around them the Middle East is changing .
the Arab spring has thrown the pieces up in the air , and , like it or not , the Palestinians and Israelis are caught up in the regional turmoil .
maybe this will make their struggle blo@@ odi@@ er than before .
however , there are reasons for thinking it could just break their lethal stalemate .
a war that is neither lost or won
at first sight , optimism looks very hard to justify now .
even if the ceasefire agreed on November 21st holds , this week &apos;s fighting has strengthened the ha@@ w@@ ks on both sides .
the leaders of Hamas , the Islamist movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007 , will claim to have forced the Israelis to back off , even though Gaza has taken a dru@@ bbing .
despite killing some of its leaders and bot@@ tling up Gaza &apos;s 1.7m people in one of the most w@@ ret@@ ched and crowded corners of the planet , Israel has failed to destroy Hamas .
indeed Hamas is gaining on the West Bank , the other bit of Palestine currently run by its bitter rivals in Fatah , the more moderate Palestinian faction .
moreover , Hamas &apos;s leaders may well conclude that time is on their side .
as Islamists across the Arab world have gained clout , so Hamas has made powerful and rich friends .
Turkey , a resurgent regional power that was once Israel &apos;s closest Muslim ally , has taken up Hamas &apos;s cause ; so has Qatar , one of the richest and most dynamic of the Gulf states .
jubil@@ ant Hamas people say an Islamist c@@ res@@ cent is cur@@ ving around Israel , from Lebanon in the north , where the Hizbullah party @-@ cum @-@ militia holds sway , through Syria , where rebels of an increasingly Islamist bent may topple Bashar Assad , and on down through Jordan , where Hamas &apos;s allies are men@@ ac@@ ing the king .
above all , on Israel &apos;s southern flank , the rise of the Muslim Bro@@ therhood under President Muhammad Mor@@ si in Egypt , by far the most popul@@ ous and pivotal of Arab countries , has changed the region &apos;s balance .
Hosni Mubarak , the secular desp@@ ot who ran Egypt for 30 years until his downfall in 2011 , had little time for Hamas .
by contrast , the Bro@@ therhood is a cousin of Hamas , and its leaders are more subject to popular opinion .
in future diplomacy Hamas may emerge as an actor that cannot be shut out even by Israel and America .
meanwhile , Israel &apos;s hardliners will draw the opposite conclusions .
in military terms , Hamas has been put back in its box .
Israel &apos;s Iron dome anti @-@ missile system has proved its worth and many of Hamas &apos;s missiles have been destroyed .
Israelis will sleep more soundly - for a while .
in diplomatic terms , America is as steadfast as ever ; many European countries also blamed Hamas for starting the latest round of violence .
above all , Israel has prosper@@ ed , especially under Bin@@ y@@ amin Netanyahu , a prime minister who has largely ignored the peace process .
although rockets from Gaza have killed around 30 Israelis since 2004 , Israel has been fairly free of suicide @-@ bombers , thanks in part to the barrier that Bi@@ tes into the West Bank , the main chun@@ k of a would @-@ be Palestinian state , and protects the Jewish settlements that continue to expand despite their il@@ legality in international law .
Mr Netanyahu , whose Lik@@ ud party has merged with an even more ha@@ w@@ k@@ ish lot under Avigdor Lieberman in the run @-@ up to an election on January 22nd , is sitting pretty .
why co@@ d@@ dle those tw@@ ist@@ y Palestinians by giving them a state of their own ?
if they really ran the West Bank , would they not fire rockets , just as their compatriots have done in Gaza ?
better to keep them behind that wall and sm@@ ite them if they raise their heads .
maybe the hardliners will win out ; yet the Arab spring may change their calculations .
even if the Islamists taking power in Egypt and elsewhere have little love for Israel , their priority will be tackling difficulties at home .
Israel &apos;s defence budget is bigger than that of its four Arab neighbours combined .
starting a war with the local superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments mend their economies .
that the pragmatic Mr Mor@@ si worked with Barack Obama to obtain a ceasefire aug@@ urs well - and might just mark the start of something .
Israelis too should look to the longer term .
with the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic , depriving Palestinians of their right to self @-@ determination is creating a powder ke@@ g that is bound one day to explode in the territories occupied by Israel - much as a bus exploded in Tel Aviv this week .
repression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state , and demo@@ graphy exacerb@@ ates this as the Arab population s@@ wells .
bloody missions against Gaza every few years to knock back Hamas will exact a growing diplomatic toll .
both sides need prodding by outsiders
the answer remains the one tr@@ um@@ pe@@ ted by sensible people on both sides , most of the outside world and this newspaper : two states , with Israel ced@@ ing territory for security .
the hope - a small one in the short term - is that the ceasefire will give a little more leverage to outsiders pushing that cause .
Egypt , which must now set about stopping the flow of arms into Gaza , along with Turkey and Qatar , is better placed than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 boundaries with land swaps and a shared Jerusalem .
Arab outsiders should also press Hamas and Fatah to come together .
that would do more to create a Palestinian state than the imminent bid for virtual statehood at the UN .
Mr Obama also has a part in getting Israel to the table .
during his first term , he neglected to present his own plan for peace .
back in the White House , he is looking just as reluctant to be drawn in .
this is wo@@ efully short @-@ sighted .
America has a vital interest in a stable Middle East .
that means a peace settlement between Israel and the Palestinians .
cigarette plain packaging laws come into force in Australia
smoking warnings and dis@@ eased body parts em@@ bla@@ zoned on dul@@ l green boxes that are the same for all tobacco brands
Australia &apos;s world @-@ first laws on cigarette and tobacco plain packaging have come into force , replacing brand log@@ os and colours with generic dra@@ b olive green cover@@ ings , gru@@ es@@ ome pictures of dis@@ eased body parts and depic@@ tions of children and babies made ill by their parents &apos; smoking .
apart from the varying health warnings and images the only difference between the packs , mandatory from Saturday , are the brand names , and these are all printed in identical small fon@@ t .
it is the world &apos;s most strict regime for the packaging of tobacco .
Australia &apos;s federal government says the aim is to deter young people from smoking by stripping the habit of g@@ lam@@ our .
it is relying on studies showing that if people have not started smoking by age 26 there is a 99 % chance they will never take it up .
&quot; even from a very early age you can see that kids understand the message that the tobacco company is trying to sell through their branding , &quot; said the federal health minister , Tanya P@@ liber@@ sek , citing studies that showed , for example , children linking a crown in a logo with the idea of being a princ@@ ess .
while Australia has one of the world &apos;s lowest smoking rates and the changes will have little impact on mul@@ tin@@ ation@@ als &apos; profits , other countries are considering similar steps .
the tobacco industry lobbied hard against the laws .
tobacco firms said they would boost black market trade , leading to cheaper , more accessible cigarettes .
&quot; there will be serious unintended consequences from the legislation , &quot; said Scott Mc@@ In@@ tyre of British American Tobacco Australia .
counterfeiters from China and Indonesia will bring lots more of these products down to sell on the streets of Australia .
others say the laws have boosted their business .
Sandra H@@ a of Zico Import P@@ ty Ltd , a small family business , said demand for cigarette cases , sil@@ icon covers to mask the un@@ pal@@ atable packages , had shot up from almost nothing two months ago since British American Tobacco , Britain &apos;s Im@@ perial Tobacco , Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost a challenge to the laws in Australia &apos;s high court .
ha said Zico had sold up to 6,000 to wholesale outlets and was awaiting new stock .
this is good business for us .
the potential hitch , experts say , is the popularity of social media with the very demographic the plan is targeting .
after a series of Australian laws banning TV advertising and sports sponsorship and requiring most sellers to hide cigarettes from view , tobacco marketing has moved online .
Australia has banned web advertising by local companies and sites but cannot restrict overseas sites .
&quot; if you are a tobacco mar@@ ke@@ ter and you &apos;ve only got this small window left to promote your products , online is the compelling place for you to be in , &quot; said Bec@@ ky Freeman , a public health researcher at Sydney University .
Freeman noted an increase in &quot; average Joe &quot; reviews of brands on social media sites such as YouTube , Twitter and Facebook .
we have to ask , is that just a private citizen who really loves Mar@@ l@@ bor@@ o cigarettes and they &apos;ve gone to the trouble of making a video , or is there a marketing company involved ?
British American Tobacco Australia said the industry was focused on dealing with the new rules rather than marketing .
the industry has gone as far as paying for Ukraine , Honduras and the Domin@@ ican Republic to challenge the new rules - the countries are claiming at the World Trade Organisation that trade is being unfairly restricted , despite none of the countries having significant trade with Australia .
a WTO ruling is likely in mid @-@ 2013 .
P@@ liber@@ sek said the government had held discussions with other countries considering similar laws on packaging .
Canada was the first country to make photograph warnings mandatory in 2001 .
they now extend to more than 40 countries including Brazil , Turkey and Ukraine .
tougher laws are being considered in Britain , New Zealand , South Africa and India .
many smokers in Australia remain defiant .
the pictures don &apos;t affect me .
I just ignore them .
&quot; you just grab a smoke and put it away , &quot; said Victor El H@@ age as he purchased a pack with a photograph of a mouth tumour .
honestly , there &apos;s only one reason I &apos;d stop , and that &apos;s my little girl .
James Y@@ u , who runs the King of the Pack tobac@@ con@@ ist in central Sydney , said the uniform packaging made it harder to st@@ ack his shelves
&quot; it used to take me an hour to un@@ load a delivery , now it takes me four hours , &quot; Y@@ u said .
&quot; the government should have just banned them altogether and then we &apos;d go OK , fine , we &apos;re done , we &apos;ll shut up shop , &quot; he said , throwing his hands up in the air .
in a Constan@@ tly plu@@ gged @-@ In World , It &apos;s Not All Bad to Be bo@@ red
I spent five unexpected hours in an airport this Than@@ ks@@ giving holiday when our plane had mechanical difficulties and we had to wait for another plane to arrive .
so I had plenty of time to think about the subject of bo@@ re@@ dom .
I won &apos;t lie to you .
half a day in an airport waiting for a flight is pretty te@@ dious , even with the dist@@ ractions of books , magazines and i@@ Ph@@ ones ( not to mention duty @-@ free shopping ) .
but increasingly , some academics and child development experts are coming out in praise of bo@@ re@@ dom .
it &apos;s all right for us - and our children - to be bo@@ red on occasion , they say .
it forces the brain to go on interesting tan@@ gents , perhaps fostering creativity .
and because most of us are almost consistently plu@@ gged into one screen or another these days , we don &apos;t experience the benefits of bo@@ re@@ dom .
so should we embrace bo@@ re@@ dom ?
yes .
and no .
but I &apos;ll get back to that .
first of all , like many people , I assumed that bo@@ re@@ dom was a relatively recent phenomenon , with the advent of more le@@ isure time .
not so , says Peter T@@ oo@@ hey , a professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Cal@@ gar@@ y in Canada and the author of &quot; Bo@@ re@@ dom : a lively History &quot; ( Yale University Press , 2011 ) .
&quot; Bo@@ re@@ dom actually has a very long history , &quot; he said .
there &apos;s Latin graffiti about bo@@ re@@ dom on the walls of Pom@@ pe@@ ii dating from the first century .
then there &apos;s the question of how we define bo@@ re@@ dom .
the trouble is that it has been defined , and discussed , in many different ways , said John D. E@@ ast@@ wood , an associate professor of psychology at York University in On@@ tar@@ io , Canada .
after looking over the research literature and putting the idea in front of a focus group of about 100 people , Professor E@@ ast@@ wood and his colleagues defined bo@@ re@@ dom as an experience of &quot; wanting to , but being unable to engage in satisfying activity . &quot;
what separates bo@@ re@@ dom from apathy , he said , is that the person is not engaged but wants to be .
with apathy , he said , there is no urge to do something .
the core experience of bo@@ re@@ dom , he said , is &quot; disruption of the attention process , associated with a low mood and a sense that time is passing slowly . &quot;
Bo@@ re@@ dom can sound an aw@@ ful lot like depression .
but Professor E@@ ast@@ wood said that while they can be related , people who are bo@@ red tend to see the problem as the environment or the world , while people who are depressed see the problem as themselves .
sometimes we think we &apos;re bo@@ red when we just have difficulty concentrating .
in their study , &quot; The Un@@ engaged Min@@ d : defining Bo@@ re@@ dom in Ter@@ ms of At@@ tention , &quot; which appeared in the journal Perspec@@ tives on psychological Science in September , Professor E@@ ast@@ wood and his colleagues pointed to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a tape of a person reading a magazine article .
some groups heard a loud and unrelated television program in the next room , others heard it at a low level so it was barely noticeable , while the third group didn &apos;t hear the so@@ und@@ track at all .
the ones who heard the low @-@ level TV reported more bo@@ re@@ dom than the other two groups - they had difficulty concentrating but were not sure why , and attributed that difficulty to bo@@ re@@ dom .
when you &apos;re trying to focus on a difficult or engaging task , disruption of attention can lead to bo@@ re@@ dom , said Mark J. F@@ ens@@ ke , an associate professor of neur@@ os@@ ci@@ ence at the University of Gu@@ el@@ p@@ h in On@@ tar@@ io and one of the authors of the study .
on the other hand , when you &apos;re doing something dul@@ l , &quot; such as looking for bad w@@ id@@ gets on a factory line , dist@@ rac@@ ting music can help you not be bo@@ red . &quot;
in fact , he said , we now know that squ@@ ir@@ ming and do@@ od@@ ling , often seen as a sign of bo@@ re@@ dom , can actually help combat it by keeping people more physically alert .
&quot; research shows that kids who are allowed to fid@@ get learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to sit still , &quot; Professor F@@ ens@@ ke said .
we all experience bo@@ re@@ dom at some points - my flight delay , a d@@ ron@@ ing speaker , a particularly te@@ dious movie .
but some individuals are more likely to be bo@@ red than others .
to help measure this , researchers developed a &quot; Bo@@ re@@ dom P@@ ron@@ eness Scal@@ e &quot; in the 1980s .
the scale includes questions like , &quot; M@@ any things I have to do are re@@ peti@@ tive and monot@@ onous , &quot; and &quot; I have so many interests , I don &apos;t have time to do everything . &quot;
using such scales , researchers have discovered that boys tend to be bo@@ red more often than girls , said Stephen Vod@@ anovich , a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida , especially when it comes needing more , and a variety of , external stimulation .
but in general , teenagers are a pretty j@@ aded lot .
in 1991 , Re@@ ed Larson , a professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois , conducted an experiment in which he contacted almost 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day by be@@ eper .
he found that 32 percent of adolescents said they were bo@@ red in school and doing homework , while 23 percent said they were bo@@ red when they weren &apos;t in school .
on the other hand , 3 percent of parents said they were bo@@ red .
professor Larson said he did not know whether the bo@@ re@@ dom percentages now , 21 years later , would be higher or lower .
but he said he did know that &quot; adoles@@ c@@ ence is a peak period for bo@@ re@@ dom , &quot; largely because children and teenagers are not given a lot of control over what they want to do .
so back to my original question : is bo@@ re@@ dom good for you ?
sometimes no , because in its extreme it can lead people to take absurd physical risks , gamble or in@@ dul@@ ge in substance abuse as a way to ease it , research shows .
on the other hand , many philosoph@@ ers and writers discuss the connection between bo@@ re@@ dom and creativity , said Professor Vod@@ anovich , who has been studying the issue for more than two decades .
&quot; Bo@@ re@@ dom is the brain &apos;s way to tell you you should be doing something else , &quot; said Gary Marcus , a professor of psychology at N@@ .@@ Y@@ .@@ U@@ .
but the brain doesn &apos;t always know the most appropriate thing to do .
if you &apos;re bo@@ red and use that energy to play guitar and cook , it will make you happy .
but if you watch TV , it may make you happy in the short term , but not in the long term .
so if your child is bo@@ red and you give him an iPad , he may not be bo@@ red anymore , but he hasn &apos;t learned how to entertain himself , or self regulate , Professor F@@ ens@@ ke said .
and &quot; that self @-@ regulation transfers from one situation to other , &quot; he said .
your kid doesn &apos;t just learn to entertain himself , but gets more self @-@ control in other areas .
I don &apos;t think we really want to celebrate bo@@ re@@ dom .
nor should we be too critical of it .
rather , our goal should be to feel comfortable away from the constant chat@@ ter of activity and technology .
professor E@@ ast@@ wood agreed .
&quot; we frame it as we need to be bo@@ red more , but bo@@ re@@ dom is an agon@@ izing , rest@@ less desire to be connected with something meaningful , &quot; he said .
what people are really searching for , he said , is a way to un@@ plug and enjoy down time .
&quot; in an environment where we are constantly over@@ stimulated , &quot; he said , &quot; it &apos;s hard to find ways to engage when the noise shuts down . &quot;
in Colorado , No P@@ lay@@ book for New marijuana Law
Anthony O@@ roz@@ co , 19 , a community college student and soccer player in southeastern Colorado , is facing criminal charges for something that will soon be legal across this state : the possession of a few n@@ ug@@ gets of marijuana and a pipe he used to smoke it .
Mr. O@@ roz@@ co said that one day in September he and a few friends were driving in L@@ amar , on the pla@@ ins near the Kan@@ sas border , when they were pulled over .
after the police officer found marijuana in the car , Mr. O@@ roz@@ co was issued a sum@@ mons for possession and drug par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ alia - petty offen@@ ses that each carry a $ 100 fine - and given a court date .
&quot; we get treated like criminals , &quot; Mr. O@@ roz@@ co said .
but is he one ?
in the uncertain weeks after Colorado &apos;s vote to leg@@ alize small amounts of marijuana for recreational use , the answer in hundreds of minor drug cases depends less on the law than on location .
hundreds of misdemeanor marijuana cases are already being dropped here and in Washington State , which approved a similar measure .
police departments have stopped charging adults 21 years and older for small @-@ scale possession that will be legally sanctioned once the laws take effect in the coming weeks .
but prosecutors in more conservative precinc@@ ts in Colorado have vowed to press ahead with existing marijuana cases and are still citing people for possession .
at the same time , several towns from the Den@@ ver suburbs to the Western mountains are voting to block new , state @-@ licensed retail marijuana shops from opening in their communities .
&quot; this thing is evolving so quickly that I don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to happen next , &quot; said Daniel J. O@@ ates , the police chief in Aurora , just east of Den@@ ver .
regulators in Washington State are also scr@@ at@@ ching their heads .
and they are looking for guidance on how to set up a system of licenses for production , manufacturing , distribution and sales - all by a deadline of Dec@@ . 1 , 2013 .
they say that Colorado , for better or worse , is ahead of most states in regulating marijuana , first for medical use and now recre@@ ation@@ ally .
&quot; Colorado has a more regulated market , so they will be a good guide , &quot; said Brian E. Smith , a spokesman for the Washington State liquor Control Board .
but no place or system , Mr. Smith conceded , can do more than suggest what might work .
&quot; there &apos;s no real precedent for us to follow , &quot; he said .
Washington &apos;s law , called I @-@ 5@@ 02 , takes effect on Dec@@ . 6 , which also leaves a year of limbo during which the state licensing system will not yet exist , but leg@@ alized possession will .
and there are thorny mechanical questions that must be resolved during that time , like how to balance the state &apos;s mandate of &quot; adequate access &quot; to licensed marijuana with its prohibitions on cannabis businesses within 1,000 feet of a school , park , playground or child care center .
&quot; nowhere will it be more difficult to site a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas , particularly in the Seattle metropolitan area , &quot; said Ben Livingston , a spokesman for the Center for Legal cannabis , a recently formed research group .
on Nov@@ . 21 , Chief O@@ ates in Aurora sent his officers an e @-@ mail announcing that the city attorney would no longer be prosecuting small marijuana violations for anyone 21 years or older , and that the police would stop charging people for those crimes &quot; effective immediately . &quot;
chief O@@ ates said that the police would enforce city codes regulating medical marijuana growers , and that they would still pursue drug traffickers and dealers .
in northern Colorado &apos;s W@@ eld County , the district attorney , K@@ en bu@@ ck , represents a stricter view .
after the vote , he said his office would continue pursuing marijuana possession cases , mostly as a way to press users into getting treatment .
right now , 119 people face charges of possessing two oun@@ ces or less of marijuana , though many are facing other charges .
&quot; our office has an obligation to prosecute offen@@ ses that were crimes at the time they occurred , &quot; Mr. bu@@ ck said in a statement .
the response has been complicated even in places like rural Mesa County , where voters rejected the marijuana initiative .
the police in Grand junction , the county &apos;s largest city , are no longer citing adults for possession of small amounts .
the county &apos;s district attorney , Pete H@@ aut@@ zinger , supported that decision , but also decided not to dismiss all of the pending possession cases .
&quot; I do not think I &apos;m wasting my time continuing to enforce the law until it changes , &quot; he said .
although 55 percent of Colorado voters supported the measure , bringing recreational marijuana into the fol@@ ds of government and the legal system was never going to be simple .
and the contradictory reactions across the state lay bare a deep ambi@@ valence among local officials about the state &apos;s big green experiment .
&quot; it &apos;s a cultural barrier &quot; with district attorneys , said Sean Mc@@ Al@@ l@@ ister , a Den@@ ver lawyer who represents marijuana defendants and is a local spokesman for the National Organization for the Reform of marijuana Laws .
&quot; they spent so much of their lives prosecuting people that they still don &apos;t really accept that this is legal , &quot; he said .
as the first states to treat small amounts of marijuana like alcohol , Colorado and Washington are poised to become national test cases for drug leg@@ alization .
as advocates and state officials plan for a new frontier of leg@@ alized sales , they are also anxi@@ ously awaiting direction from the federal government , which still plans to treat the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes .
advocates for leg@@ alized marijuana are hoping the Justice Department yields .
despite some high @-@ profile arrests of medical marijuana patients and sellers , the federal government has mostly allowed medical marijuana businesses to operate in Colorado , Washington and 16 other states .
while drug agents will probably not beat down doors to seize a small bag of the drug , they are likely to bal@@ k at allowing the state @-@ regulated recreational marijuana shops allowed under the new laws , said Kevin A. Sab@@ et , a former drug policy adviser in the Obama administration .
several cities in Colorado are not waiting for federal authorities to act .
even before Election Day , some local governments approved mor@@ at@@ ori@@ ums on any new marijuana shops , even though it will be about a year before any can open .
last week , the western city of Mon@@ tr@@ ose took up a six @-@ month ban , and is likely to pass it next week .
&quot; we don &apos;t want to be put in a position where we license somebody and then have a big federal issue , &quot; said Bob Nicholson , a City Council member .
our community voted against this amendment .
we &apos;re looking at what the community voted for versus what the state voted for .
there &apos;s an aw@@ ful lot of questions .
Pet@@ ron@@ ella W@@ yatt : I was bul@@ lied out of Oxford for being a T@@ ory
it is not just today &apos;s university students who are attacked for their views
I can &apos;t remember a time when I didn &apos;t dream of winning a place at Oxford University .
both my father and my el@@ der brother had been at what I imagined was the world &apos;s greatest seat of learning , a modern @-@ day wine @-@ b@@ lus@@ hed Greek symposium encouraging the dual pillars of civilisation , free thinking and tolerance .
yet , within two weeks of taking up my place at Wor@@ ces@@ ter College in the late eigh@@ ties to read history , I &apos;d packed my bags , precipit@@ ating the first scandal of my life .
my father broke down and cried .
friends were b@@ aff@@ led .
the Evening Standard diary claimed I &apos;d quit because I objected to fellow undergraduates having sex in the room next to mine .
the writer A N Wilson announced wag@@ g@@ ish@@ ly that I &apos;d departed because I was forced to drink out of chi@@ pped m@@ ugs .
the truth was less d@@ roll .
I ran away .
yes , ran , because I had been subject to systematic bul@@ lying and intimidation .
not on account of my rather ou@@ tr@@ Ã© name , or the fact that I came from a private school .
I was persecuted for one reason only , and in this cradle of supposed enligh@@ ten@@ ment it was both bi@@ go@@ ted and barbar@@ ic : my father , the late Woodrow W@@ yatt , was a high @-@ profile adviser to Margaret T@@ hat@@ cher and I was a Conservative supporter .
why bring this up now , you might ask .
well , recent reports suggest that a new generation of Right @-@ of @-@ centre students are suffering a similar persecution .
such is the institutionalised and increasing hatred of T@@ ory students at Oxford that last week a group of them demanded the same equal @-@ rights protection as g@@ ays , disabled people and ethnic minorities .
conservative members of Corp@@ us Christ@@ i College &apos;s junior common room ( J@@ CR ) claim they are &quot; often actively isolated , personally attacked and made to feel un@@ welcome &quot; because of their political views .
they want to create a post on the college &apos;s equal opportunities committee to ensure that their opinions can be aired freely .
their situation wasn &apos;t helped by a recent BBC Two documentary , Won@@ der@@ land : young , bright and on the Right , about student politics , which portrayed T@@ ories as od@@ d@@ balls and neo @-@ Nazis .
it featured graduate Joe Co@@ oke , former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association ( O@@ U@@ CA ) , travelling in a rolls @-@ Roy@@ ce , sporting a silver suit and silver @-@ topped cane .
at other universities , Conservative students say they are being treated as &quot; scape@@ goats &quot; for the introduction of higher tuition fees . &quot;
Luk@@ e Black , 20 , vice @-@ president of Not@@ ting@@ ham University Conservative Association , told a Sunday newspaper that &quot; there is a growing Left @-@ wing bias at universities .
people assume we are like the Bul@@ l@@ ing@@ don Club without meeting us . &quot;
Samuel Rober@@ ts , 21 , a history student at Corp@@ us Christ@@ i , who proposed the motion for greater protection , says such a climate is &quot; uncomfortable , &quot; while Stephan@@ ie Cher@@ ill , 19 , president elect of O@@ U@@ CA , says there has been a deterioration in the attitude of J@@ CR members towards people who are Right of centre .
&quot; this poses a threat to the atmosphere of intellectual discussion , as well as to the welfare of members , &quot; she says .
I was in a minority of one during my first few weeks at Oxford .
I had gone up in September 1986 , a crip@@ pl@@ ingly shy 18 @-@ year @-@ old .
hatred of the Conservative Party was at its most fe@@ br@@ ile .
the year before , the university had voted to refuse Margaret T@@ hat@@ cher - a former student - an honorary degree , because of cuts in higher education funding .
the atmosphere would have made a Stalinist shu@@ dder with apprehension .
during the first few days of fres@@ hers &quot; week , when new students socialise with each other and the dons , I had a taste of the wor@@ m@@ wood that was to come .
I was to find that the dons not only con@@ ni@@ ved in the taun@@ ting of T@@ ory undergraduates but took part with re@@ lish .
the politics of the miners &quot; strike , privatisation and the government &apos;s opposition to sanctions against ap@@ ar@@ the@@ id South Africa were brought into the wood @-@ pan@@ elled rooms of the tut@@ orial .
my first one involved translating 18th @-@ century French texts into English , and I was unprepared for what followed .
&quot; Miss W@@ yatt , &quot; said the don , Harry Pitt ( now deceased ) , &quot; please translate the first paragrap@@ h . &quot;
I stumbled over it .
a small man with a face like cake bat@@ ter , Pitt was big on bile .
&quot; do T@@ hat@@ cher@@ ites refuse to learn French or are they just stupid ? &quot; he demanded .
the other undergraduates gi@@ gg@@ led .
tears pri@@ cked the back of my eyes .
&quot; I suggest you take some basic French lessons in your spare time - that is , if you &apos;re not too busy soci@@ alising , &quot; Pitt snar@@ led .
I walked back to my rooms a dis@@ con@@ so@@ late figure .
at dinner in college that evening I sat by myself ; then I felt a light tap on my shoulder .
it was a second @-@ year English student named James who introduced himself as a member of the O@@ U@@ CA .
&quot; I know who you are , &quot; he said kindly .
I &apos;m afraid it &apos;s like that .
anyone suspected of being a T@@ ory is picked on .
it &apos;s bad enough for me , but they know your father is close to Margaret T@@ hat@@ cher , so it will be worse for you .
most T@@ ory fres@@ hers pretend they &apos;re Labour .
later , at a local pu@@ b , I cra@@ ven@@ ly attempted to dissi@@ mu@@ late .
I insisted that I didn &apos;t agree with everything Mr@@ s T@@ hat@@ cher said .
this ploy proved unsuccessful .
a first year P@@ PE student , who , ironically , had been to E@@ ton , said : &quot; you &apos;re the daughter of a fascist pig . &quot;
you &apos;re contaminated .
other students took up the refrain .
I was perver@@ ted , dirty .
&quot; how do T@@ ories have sex ? &quot; one asked .
they beat each other , don &apos;t they ?
I felt the way homosexu@@ als must have felt before the liberal legislation of the six@@ ties .
would I ever be able to lead a normal life at Oxford ?
would I be forced to meet like @-@ minded people only after dark ?
would I have to turn to Labour and suppress my natural inclin@@ ations ?
the three years before me stretched out as a pur@@ g@@ atory of os@@ trac@@ ism and isolation .
the only openly T@@ ory don was Norman Stone , Professor of Modern History , who was based at my college .
he was ha@@ ted for being not only a Conservative but a foreign policy adviser to T@@ hat@@ cher and one of her speech writers .
he was hardly ever there .
he lo@@ ath@@ ed the place as provincial and petty , and for its adherence to the Marxist @-@ determin@@ ist view of history .
in 1997 he took up a profes@@ sor@@ ship at the University of Bilkent , in Ankara , Turkey .
&quot; you won &apos;t be happy here , &quot; he told me .
I began comm@@ uting from Oxford to my parents &quot; house in London , finding refuge with my more open @-@ minded metropolitan friends and family .
I told my father I ha@@ ted Oxford and why .
he was incre@@ dul@@ ous .
during his time there in the for@@ ties , all political views had been accepted .
&quot; but it &apos;s the best place in the world , &quot; he said pa@@ the@@ tically .
they wouldn &apos;t do that , not among my dre@@ aming sp@@ ires .
even my Communist friends always had im@@ pec@@ cable man@@ ners .
his r@@ he@@ um@@ y eyes began to cloud .
give it a chance .
I &apos;m sure it &apos;s all just a te@@ ase .
it would break my heart if you left .
exhausted by my frequent trips to London , my emotional resistance was deteriorating .
a male friend of mine , also a T@@ ory supporter , had succumbed to pressure and ren@@ ounced his cre@@ ed .
during a tut@@ orial the following week , when another history don had suggested , in complete seriousness , that I was an &quot; enemy of the people , &quot; I decided to do the same .
In@@ war@@ dly b@@ lus@@ hing with shame , I admitted to being &quot; bra@@ in@@ washed by my parents &quot; and called them &quot; old fo@@ ols . &quot;
the respite was short .
it was my father who drove the nail into the coffin of my Oxford career .
at the time , he wrote two columns in the Mur@@ do@@ ch press each week .
my door was locked .
I co@@ w@@ ered inside , and after five minutes , my pursu@@ ers gave up .
when they left , I packed a su@@ it@@ case and caught the first train to London .
I never went back .
you may call me a sni@@ v@@ elling w@@ im@@ p .
but no 18 @-@ year @-@ old should be subject to such intimidation and vit@@ ri@@ ol in an educational institution .
even more tragic is that it was Oxford , which not only produced 14 T@@ ory prime ministers , but , to this day , hi@@ des behind an ill @-@ deserved reputation for equality and freedom of thought .
two people drowned in floods in Trabzon
the I@@ kis@@ u cre@@ ek over@@ flowed on account of heavy rainfall in the district of Y@@ om@@ ra in Trabzon .
two women disappeared in the flo@@ od@@ waters in the village of Tas@@ de@@ len and the road to the village of Say@@ van was closed .
the body of one of the women drowned in the floods was found .
there was precip@@ itation in the high@@ lands of Y@@ om@@ ra at around 15 : 00 .
when the I@@ kis@@ u cre@@ ek over@@ flowed , a section almost 200 meters of the road connecting I@@ kis@@ u to Say@@ van was flooded .
one of the village &apos;s residents , Ibrahim Kar@@ s@@ lÄ± , said that work on opening the road had not started despite the authorities being alerted . &quot; the road has been closed for 3 hours .
we experience the same after every heavy rainfall .
we have alerted the authorities but no one has come so far .
the local residents are unhappy .
we endure this hardship every year .
when the trees block the cre@@ ek , the water reaches up to the road , &quot; he said .
one person &apos;@@ S body was found
the mayor of Y@@ om@@ ra , Ibrahim SaÄ@@ Ä±@@ ro@@ Älu , reported that the body of one of the women who drowned in the floods after heavy rainfall in the district has been found , the search for the other person was being continued .
SaÄ@@ Ä±@@ ro@@ Älu reminded that two women collecting nuts in the village of TaÅ@@ de@@ len village were washed away in the flo@@ od@@ waters caused by yesterday &apos;s torrential rains in the district .
SaÄ@@ Ä±@@ ro@@ Älu said that the search was conducted until late in the night and started again early in the morning : &quot; thanks to the machinery and work by the municipal corporation , the body of one of our fellow countrymen has been found , the search is being continued for the other , &quot; he said .
SaÄ@@ Ä±@@ ro@@ Älu added that the impact of the rainfall has diminished , the weather has become more sunny , and the search for the missing person and the work on closed roads were progressing easily .
he said that while the search for the missing women was in progress , the road to Tas@@ de@@ len village is now open to traffic .
&quot; it would B@@ E levelled TO the ground &quot;
the residents of Tas@@ de@@ len in the district of Y@@ om@@ ra are trying to reconcile themselves to the loss and damage caused by the torrential floods and landslide .
Der@@ ya , a resident of Tas@@ de@@ len said that the rainfall continued for about three hours un@@ interrup@@ tedly and said &quot; It was not a rainfall , but a natural disaster . &quot;
TaÅ@@ kara said that many people evacuated their homes fearing a landslide during the torrential rains ; &quot; We stopped collecting nuts .
that is when such a disaster struck .
the bride and her mother @-@ in @-@ law were collecting nuts during the flood .
they were trapped in a landslide on their way home , &quot; he said .
TaÅ@@ kara added that supply of electricity and water to the village had been disrupted .
Hasan Selim said that in 60 years of his life , he had never seen such torrential rains and added , &quot; If the rains had continued for an hour longer , everything there would have been flattened . &quot;

DoÄa College grants students having O@@ YP scores between 4@@ 81 and 490 with 75 % scholarships , between 4@@ 71 and 480 with 60 % scholarships , and between 4@@ 51 and 470 with 50 % scholarships .
&quot; our investment in our students is an investment in the future of Turkey . &quot;
with regard to the scholarship grants and underlining that they are always proud of their students , CEO of DoÄa College UÄur Gaz@@ an@@ ker said , &quot; DoÄa College strives to raise generations who are successful not only in academics but also in every walk of life . &quot;
in line with this objective , we are guiding our students towards better achievements by acknowledging and rewarding all their accomplishments , from academic to sports and from art to music .
as academicians , we are aware that the area of success for each student is different .
the important thing is to identify their areas of success by discovering them and encouraging them to fortify their strengths .
we act with the awareness that the investment in the education of our students is an investment in the future of Turkey and reward every success that they achieve , &quot; he said .
winning is always good
Ã@@ mit Dav@@ ala said that they played a tough match . &quot; it was not easy to win the three points but winning is grati@@ fying , &quot; he said .
Galatasaray assistant coach Ã@@ mit Dav@@ ala said it was grati@@ fying to have started the season with a victory over Gazian@@ tep@@ spor .
Dav@@ ala said that they won two tro@@ p@@ hies before the new season and played a comfortable football game in general , despite having trouble in some aspects , and said , &quot; winning always feels nice .
Gazian@@ tep@@ spor is an effective team . however , everything was easy for us after we scored the goals , &quot; he said .
the match with Bursa W@@ IL@@ L not B@@ E easy
adding that the fans and players missed each other and they granted three points to the finish , Ã@@ mit Dav@@ ala said , &quot; We now have a tough match to displace Bur@@ s@@ as@@ por .
matches are not won easily .
we do not take the victory over our opponents for granted as they claim . the Gazian@@ tep@@ spor match is proof of that , &quot; he said .

I will put in all efforts to respond to you as soon as possible .
what is retirement due to disability ?
retirement due to disability means that , regardless of age , if those insured with S@@ SK or Ba@@ Ä @-@ Kur lose at least 60 % of their working ability and become dysfunctional , to sustain their lives and provided that they meet the insurance requirements as stipulated by the S@@ GK legislation , they are given option of early retirement .
public servants , apart from the above @-@ mentioned , may be given early retirement if they lose their occup@@ ational earning power to the extent that they cannot perform their duties .
who are considered disabled ?
I am writing from Diyarbakir , my name is Mehmet GÃ¼l@@ tekin and I have 9@@ 20 days of insurance with an additional 540 days credit from my military service making up a total of 1,4@@ 60 days of insurance premium paid in all .
also , I have ren@@ al disease .
I am undergoing di@@ aly@@ sis treatment .
I am currently employed .
am I entitled to get disability pension ?
Mehmet , first of all , please get well soon .
among the circumstances you have indicated in your qu@@ ery , you have not indicated when you first started work .
however , let me tell you how you could be entitled to a disability pension .
first , the most important requirement specified by law is that you must be insured for 10 years and must have paid insurance premium for a total of 1,800 days .
moreover , you are deemed disabled when it is diagnosed by the S@@ GK Health Council that you have lost at least 60 % of your working ability caused by work @-@ related accident or an occup@@ ational disease .
however , you meet the 60 % requirement by being a di@@ aly@@ sis patient , but you are not entitled to pension because you did not complete payment of premium for 1,800 days .
of course , we do not know how long you have been working .
you will be granted pension if you apply to the S@@ GK on the day you relinquish work when you complete 10 years and premium payment for 1,800 days .
conditions for entit@@ lement to disability pension
can a person retire without meeting the criteria of 10 years and premium payment for 1,800 days required for entit@@ lement to pension ?
- You must complete payment of premium for 1,800 days .
there is only one exception : for those for whom it has been decided that they are in need of constant nursing and care by someone else , they may be entitled to disability pension without the 10 @-@ year requirement as long as they meet the other conditions .
we will talk about the illnesses or conditions that are considered in determining the dependence on constant care later in the article .
the status of those who are disabled before starting work
I am Ahmet GÃ¼ler .
I was told that I am not entitled to disability pension even though I met all the requirements in the S@@ GK law since I was disabled before I started working .
I have been treated unjustly .
is this not unfair ?
how can I retire ?
- Ahmet , you have written that you meet all the requirements of the law but one of the main requirements of the law is that those insured with S@@ SK and Ba@@ Ä @-@ Kur should not have been suffering from any illnesses that prevent you from working before you even start working .
disability pension cannot be granted to you since you do not meet this criterion .
however , you can retire when you meet all the conditions for receiving an old @-@ age pension .
- I have 39@@ 80 days and I am insured for 16 years .
the S@@ GK has diagnosed that my disability commenced before I started work .
they said I could not retire on grounds of disability .
in this case , what can I do ?
will I not be able to retire ?
can you show me a way ?
- Yes , you heard right .
you cannot retire on account of disability .
but in the S@@ GK legislation , there is a retirement option for you too .
in other words , there are two situations : before October 2008 and after October 2008 .
if you first started working before that date , and in case S@@ GK establishes that you were disabled before starting work , you may be granted partial old @-@ age pension with the condition of having been insured for at least 15 years and having paid insurance premium for 3,600 days .
for this reason , we recommend that you contact your nearest S@@ GK Directorate and apply for pension .
- But if you started work after October 2008 , you may be granted old @-@ age pension on the condition that you were insured for at least fifteen years and have paid at least 3,@@ 9@@ 60 days of premium for disability , old age and life insurance .
do I have to quit work in order to apply ?
at present , I am employed as a driver .
I was diagnosed with cancer when I visited the hospital .
I want to retire on grounds of disability .
in this case , do I have to quit work ?
can I apply for pension without quitting work ?
I do not want to be out of work until pension is granted .
- You heard right .
to submit your pension request , you must quit work .
however , before applying for pension , you must be diagnosed as being disabled according to the S@@ GK law .
however , if you are disabled you are granted pension with the other conditions .
there is no point in making an application for pension before being diagnosed as being disabled , but there is a risk of being unemployed .
for this , it is enough that you have 1,800 days .
when you submit your application to the S@@ GK to di@@ ag@@ n@@ ose your disability , the S@@ GK will direct you to an authorized hospital .
when you submit the health council report ( concerning your cancer diagnosis ) to the S@@ GK , the latter will evaluate it by its own health council and if they decide that because of the cancer you have lost more than 60 % of your working ability , then this will be the reason for your pension application .
however , to be granted pension you must complete 10 years of payment of premium to the insurance company , and if you have completed this period you will be granted pension .
in other words , we can say briefly that it is unwise for those employed and insured to make applications without the decision of the S@@ GK health council that they are disabled .
but every unemployed insured , if they meet all the conditions , can request the diagnosis of disability status and pension from the S@@ GK at the same time .
this may be helpful in order to get pension granted at a somewhat earlier date if they are disabled and meet all the other requirements .
can a Ba@@ Ä @-@ Kur debtor retire on account of disability ?
I am insured by Ba@@ Ä @-@ Kur .
I meet all the conditions .
however , they said that I could not retire since I have a debt .
what should I do ?
- De@@ ar reader ,
whoever told you that is correct .
you did not write what the other conditions are , but if you think that you meet those conditions , it is a legal requirement that you must pay your 4 / b premium debt .
but I can give you special advice .
since you will be granted pension , I suggest that you repay your debt by involving the banks or similar institutions .
the earlier you are granted pension , the more you will be paid , and you will be able to repay your debt .
it will be easy to get credit since these institutions will de@@ duc@@ t the repayment installments from your pension .
what is the basis for granting the disability pension ?
I worked in accordance with the S@@ SK , Ba@@ Ä @-@ Kur and retirement Funds .
when am I entitled to a pension and which institution will grant me the pension ?
- De@@ ar reader , if you have worked with more than one status - as Ba@@ Ä @-@ Kur , S@@ GK or a civil servant - your disability pension will be granted by the very last insurance status . in other words , if your last position was insured by S@@ GK , you will be paid by S@@ GK if you resign from work and meet all the other conditions .
hospital reports that are valid at the S@@ GK
how do I apply for disability ?
which are the hospitals from where I can get a health report ?
for health council reports , it is sufficient to apply to the provincial social security directorates or social security centres .
the S@@ GK will ask you to visit an educational and research hospital associated with the Ministry of Health , a University hospital ( excluding private university and foundation hospitals ) or a military hospital of the Turkish Armed Forces .
however , if those hospitals are not present in the province where you live , you may be sent to a fully established hospital run by the Ministry of Health .
can I be sent to a private hospital ?
- It is possible , but there are conditions applicable .
according to the former legislation , only those patients in state hospital intensive care units with an emergency risk can be referred to the hospitals where they are , but with the new regulations coming into force with effect from 1 September , 2013 , as long as the hospital has an agreement with the S@@ GK , intensive care patients with an emergency risk can be referred to the hospital where they are even if this hospital is private and the health council reports of those hospitals will also be valid .
what are the requirements for an operation prescribed by referral ?
to carry out referral operations that di@@ ag@@ n@@ ose the disability status of the insured , it is sufficient to have paid the premium for 1,800 days .
hospital expenses related to establishing the disability status are paid by the S@@ GK .
moreover , the 10 @-@ year insurance period is not required . what the S@@ GK looks for is this :
in case of a disability pension grant , if the person is in need of care , only 1,800 days will be sufficient without the 10 @-@ year requirement and the pension is granted on the basis of the health council report .
for this reason , when the person requests diagnosis of his or her disability for the first time , the S@@ GK checks only the 1,800 day requirement in case of a disability that needs nursing care .
Nar@@ gh@@ ile operation
the police have begun to check the bans introduced in Nar@@ gh@@ ile cafes .
many shops and establishments had to stop selling nar@@ gh@@ ile after inspections were carried out over the weekend .
the police began to organize operations at nar@@ gh@@ ile cafes in Istanbul in response to new regulations that were being enforced .
Nar@@ gh@@ ile sales were stopped in establishments without a licence after conducting an operation in nar@@ gh@@ ile cafes in the BeÅiktaÅ area .
while almost all nar@@ gh@@ ile cafes were affected by the raids , penalties shall be imposed on cafes that continue to sell nar@@ gh@@ ile .
shops and establishments that continue selling shall be shut down .
sales have been banned
the Tobacco and Al@@ co@@ hol Market Regulatory Authority ( TA@@ PDK ) published the &quot; Regula@@ tions on the Issue of conformity certificates to the Area ( s ) of Nar@@ gh@@ ile Tobacco Produc@@ t Sm@@ oking shops and establishments and the Requi@@ rements to be met in order to operate such Pla@@ ces &quot; last February .
a notification was issued granting a five @-@ month period to move nar@@ gh@@ ile cafes at least 200 meters away from schools .
it is also prohibited to smoke nar@@ gh@@ ile in public indoor venues .
the first set of raids against shops and establishments not complying with the notification commenced yesterday in BeÅiktaÅ .
many establishments without a nar@@ gh@@ ile licence had to discontinue sales , including the most popular nar@@ gh@@ ile cafes in the ne@@ ig@@ bour@@ hoods of Istanbul such as Al F@@ aker in Be@@ bek , Ä°k@@ ram Nar@@ gh@@ ile in Ih@@ la@@ mur Kas@@ ri and M@@ is Nar@@ gh@@ ile Cafe in the BeÅiktaÅ marketplace .
fines start from 23,000 TL
the police will impose fines starting from 23,000 TL if these establishments without a licence continue selling nar@@ gh@@ ile .
the shops and establishments that are fined three times will be shut down and sealed .
apparently , there are only five shops and establishments at present having a valid nar@@ gh@@ ile cafe license in Istanbul .
warnings were af@@ fixed to bottles
the TA@@ PDK made it mandatory to put a &apos; warning &apos; holo@@ gram on nar@@ gh@@ ile bottles with effect from July 27 . in compliance with the notification published , the health warnings must be in cy@@ lin@@ dri@@ cal or con@@ ical form according to the form of the bottle .
warning stickers are af@@ fixed to the device starting from the mouth@@ piece of the bottle .
stickers with health warnings printed in blue , red , yellow and black can be used .
at the moment , such warning stickers are af@@ fixed to many cafes .
a critical warning has been issued by the Police to families
the Security General Directorate is warning families about events called &quot; summer camps &quot; and &quot; student camps &quot; by illegal organizations in order to recruit followers .
teams from the Anti @-@ Terror Bran@@ ch Directorate , based on intelligence collected in 17 cities , discovered a new plan by organizations that apparently engaged in acts of violence during the Ge@@ zi Park event including the DH@@ KP @-@ C , M@@ L@@ KP , T@@ KP , TK@@ IP and some legal groups .
security forces identified terror organizations that were organiz@@ ing camps under the name of &quot; summer camp &quot; and &quot; student camp &quot; for young people to recruit followers and warned families not to send their children to these camps .
anti @-@ terror police units established that the organizations were planning 41 camps in different provinces and met with families to request them not to send their children to these camps .
350 families deterred from sending their children to camps
anti @-@ terror police established that the organizations , especially the DH@@ KP @-@ C , M@@ L@@ KP and TK@@ IP , planned to recruit young people by using their legal extensions and warned the families that they contacted about the events being organized under the gu@@ ise of camps .
350 families followed the advice given by the Police and decided not to send their children to the camps .
after the police warnings , 14 of 41 planned camps were cancelled .
the organizations held 20 camps despite the reduced level of attendance .
security forces indicated that two camps are still in progress and five others are scheduled to be held in the days to come .
the Security General Directorate also sent warning letters regarding the camps to the relevant security organizations in all the provinces .
young people are being trapped
it was discovered that 20 terror organization &apos;s camps were organized in Izmir , Kocaeli , BalÄ±k@@ esir , Ãanakkale , Ni@@ Ä@@ de , Es@@ kiÅ@@ ehir , Bursa , Bart@@ Ä±n , Art@@ vin , Mersin and Hatay , while those cancelled were in Ordu , Samsun , Trabzon , Bart@@ Ä±n , Izmir , B@@ olu and Adana .
according to security reports , most of those attending the camps were students who joined the University recently .
illegal organizations are tr@@ apping and recruiting young people with the propaganda spread in the camps .
at the camps , new recruits are trained to enhance loyalty to the organization .
in these camps , under the mask of &quot; summer camps , &quot; training on such questions as &quot; how to convert actions into violence &quot; was also im@@ par@@ ted along with organiz@@ ational training .
message revealed after half a century
a message in a bottle thrown into the Atlantic Oc@@ ean 50 years ago by a child called Dennis Kom@@ sa was found by someone in the state of New Jersey , USA .
the glass bottle was found in debris around a house after Hurricane Sand@@ y struck last year in the USA .
the message read : &quot; to the person concerned , please answer the questions given below and send them to the following address .
this is a scientific study being conducted by Dennis Kom@@ sa ( 12 ) . &quot;
the message requested that the fin@@ der of the bottle to replies about where , when and how they found it .
in the bottle , there was also an envelop@@ e and small change for the post@@ age .
the bottle was found about 35 kilometers from where it was thrown into the ocean on the coast off New Jersey , dated 16 August 1963 , and was recently returned to its owner .
Kom@@ sa , who was 12 years old in 1963 , said he was surprised to see the bottle he threw into the ocean almost half a century earlier , and said : &quot; I threw it to the water thinking that someone would find it . but I never thought that it would get back to me . &quot;
audio frequencies can make you fall in love
I was so surprised when one of Turkey &apos;s first audio engineers , SÃ¼@@ den Pamir , said what could be done with audio frequencies .
when you talk of sound technologies or sound engineering , I believe that almost every one immediately thinks of sound systems related to music .
but did you know that sound technologies could prevent acts of terrorism , commit the perfect murder with an audio frequency point pul@@ se , make anyone you wish to fall in love with you , make someone confes@@ s a secret or could help you harmon@@ ize with the rhythm of the world ?
after graduating from the Department of Interior Design at Bilkent University , SÃ¼@@ den Pamir took a degree in audio engineering from SA@@ E College in the UK and completed his Master &apos;s on audio technologies at Mid@@ d@@ le@@ sex University .
he now trains audio engineers at the Communication Technology Music Academy IT@@ M , which he founded in Galatasaray , BeyoÄlu , and teaches subjects such as music technology , audio technology , performance technologies , electronic music and advance recording techniques .
a sub@@ li@@ minal message to terrorism
&quot; what is sound technology exactly ? &quot; was my first question .
&quot; a technology that can be applied to several fields all over the world .
our brain perce@@ ives everything with the help of electrical currents .
sound frequency is also a type of electrical current ; it is energy .
by using this energy , you can change people &apos;s perception or make them move with under the control of your command . , &quot; I got the answer .
one of the important sub @-@ branches of sound technology is sub@@ li@@ minal messaging .
a message can be placed in music or song at a frequency beyond the limits of human perception , which cannot be identified by the conscious but it gets registered by the sub@@ conscious .
for example , when the threat of a terrorist attack is received , music can be broadcast in that area , according to Pamir .
if in the broadcast song , a message such as &quot; Do not carry out this attack &quot; is placed at a different frequency , the terrorist registers this message by selective perception .
he cannot understand what he he@@ ars but his sub@@ conscious perce@@ ives it and he feels a voice from inside saying , &quot; Don &apos;t do it . &quot;
he may even perceive it as if it were a message from God .
however , this type of sub@@ li@@ minal message is controlled strictly since it constitutes a public safety risk in Turkey and in the world .
SÃ¼@@ den Pamir only once prepared a sub@@ li@@ minal message during a conference at Istanbul Technical University to explain the subject to students .
&quot; I made the students listen to music during the conference .
I incorporated a voice begging for water at a certain frequency in the music .
at the end of my presentation , I asked the students if they were thirsty .
surprisingly , they were all very thirsty , &quot; he explained this experiment .
according to Pamir , sub@@ li@@ minal messages are used illegally and says , &quot; In our country , it has been established that some radio channels in our country did this but the details are unknown .
there is a channel called Radio of the Black Voice in Germany , a frequency used by radical Islamists .
it sub@@ limin@@ ally spreads extremely violent , religious messages calling for ji@@ had and encouraging the use of drugs .
both German and Turkish police are aware of this but they cannot prevent it since the perpetrators keep changing frequencies , &quot; he says .
these types of dangerous messages are being used in the music world too .
especially in the songs of some heavy metal groups ...
allegedly , there were no terrorists in the planes that hit the towers ; the attacks were made by sub@@ li@@ minal commands sent directly to the pilot &apos;s sub @-@ conscious mind .
conf@@ id@@ ant Table
audio technologies can be used for crime as well .
this science is used especially during bank robberies in the USA .
for example , when the police contact the rob@@ ber on the phone , audio engineers can determine where , in which room of the bank the person is from the sound of the telephone .
the echo generated by a sound when it imp@@ in@@ ges on metal , wood , plastic , a wall or any other surface is different in each case .
depending on the nature of the sound &apos;s echo , it is possible to determine the size and even the shape of the room he or she is in , and how many corners there are .
in this manner , by the criminal &apos;s voice it can be determined , which kind of objects there are and the size and shape of the room he or she is in .
there is a computer program to do this and Pamir has made drawings for an opera building in Tatar@@ stan with this program , &quot; I calculated the location of 175 audio speakers in the building to achieve a perfect sound system .
it is not an expensive technology , and costs 4000 @-@ 5000 dollars &quot; he says .
audio frequencies are used in architecture and interior design too .
Pamir does a lot of work in this subject .
for example , in a restaurant where businessmen are holding a meeting , a mechanism can be installed to prevent sound waves moving away from the meeting table .
only those at the table can hear what is said at the table .
somebody standing two steps away cannot hear anything said at the table .
the general principle of such mechanisms is as follows : &quot; if you want to destroy a sound , you have to make it clash with another sound at the same frequency , and with the opposite of its own molecular structure and cancel the existing sound energy by converting it to heat .
one could never get on a plane if such a system did not exist .
the reason is that the sound of the plane &apos;s engines are too loud to tolerate .
on a plane , these sounds are made to clash with each other to cancel themselves .
with this system you can create a peaceful environment away from the noise in your home and even if your windows are open . &quot;
were the Egyptian Pyra@@ mids made by sound ?
there are other interesting works done by Pamir , one of the Turkey &apos;s first audio engineers .
for example , he developed a mechanism that prevents the sound of music from being heard outside an open @-@ air dis@@ co in Ay@@ v@@ alÄ±k .
the sound cannot go any further than the boundary ; it clashes with another audio frequency and gets cancelled .
if desired , it can be cancelled even beyond a defined line inside a room .
Pamir made a school &apos;s sports arena suitable for both sports and concerts .
it has dual use .
an echo is required when playing basketball but during a concert there should be no echo .
it is possible with sound technologies to provide sound quality such that only music can be heard in open @-@ air concerts .
&quot; we cancel unnecessary sounds perceived as noise , and use frequencies that correct human perception and facilitate better perception of music .
MTV is very advanced in this subject .
they held open @-@ air concerts and the sound was like that of a studio record in the field , &quot; he explains .
TUBITAK did such an experiment too .
separate two plates of aluminum with frequencies in the audio range .
there are scientists who claim that Egyptian Pyra@@ mids were made by sound .
they think that the stones could have been be moved and put in place by sound .
&quot; can sound be easily used for malicious purposes ? &quot; I ask .
&quot; I was already very scared when I read the studies by the University of York on the Internet since others could read it too .
the reason is that it can lead to unbeliev@@ ably bad consequences if the studies documented were tried beyond lab conditions even if this were to be done by people in good faith , &quot; he answers .
&quot; prayers are effective in Arabic &quot;
SÃ¼@@ den Pamir says that noise pollution can affect people un@@ favourably and explains , &quot; all sounds that enter the ears are transmitted to the brain .
actually , people hear only those sounds that they focus on , but all the other sounds are also transmitted to the brain and it is tiring .
that is why the brain needs to be cleared ; walking bar@@ ef@@ oo@@ t on the ground and hi@@ king in natural terrain can help .
in my opinion , mechanisms need to be set up in schools to absorb noise .
in this way , students can focus entirely on the teacher &apos;s voice and they can maintain their concentration for longer periods of time . &quot;
Pamir says that based on the properties of audio frequencies , prayers are more effective when they are read in Arabic , and he indicates that Arabic has a very rich range of audio frequencies and points out that the words are organized in a way to create positive effects when they are read out together .
&quot; but the prayers must be read out loud . I tre@@ m@@ ble like a flower when I read the verse of Yasin . &quot; he says .
describing love with frequency
the question that arises is whether it is possible to make someone fall in love with audio frequencies .
Pamir so describes the frequency that makes fall in love , or rather , stimulate one &apos;s feelings , by saying , &quot; First , you need to find the dominant frequency that the person you want to fall in love uses when talking .
you can impress him or her by using a higher frequency than this frequency .
for example , let us consider that a person &apos;s dominant frequency is 300 HZ .
and you want to play music to stimulate his or her feelings when you are together .
if you reduce the strength of the single digit frequencies and increase that of the double @-@ digit frequencies of over 300 HZ in the music that you are playing , then the person is more likely to be impressed .
in this way , he or she may even fall in love with the person in front of him or her . &quot;
Pamir talks about special audio systems in the world for the politicians to deliver their speeches impres@@ sively , and when the bass frequencies are in the fore@@ ground , a politician can be perceived to be a strong one and performing artists can be perceived as a spectacular and super@@ natural being .
I ask Pamir : &quot; at the moment in Japan , they are trying to develop a Hor@@ n sound that people believe will be blown by Michael on the Day of Res@@ ur@@ rec@@ tion , so what do you think it will be like ? &quot; he says : &quot; I think it will sound close to a human voice because humans are most impressed by sounds similar to their own .
for example , the ney is a spectacular instrument , as if it were made of human breath . &quot;
gold prices will rise
Dan Hr@@ us@@ he@@ w@@ sky , senior Gold analyst at Canada Jen@@ nings Capital Inc , indicated that Govern@@ ments are trying to reduce debt by depreci@@ ating the value of currencies , and this is why gold prices would rise above its current level , and said , &quot; Gold will continue to be a secure savings commodity . &quot;
the global demand for gold , which was the most profitable avenue of investment last week , increased in the first half of the year , and Hr@@ us@@ he@@ w@@ sky made his assessments based on the price rise observed to the AA correspondent and indicated that investors in China and India appear to support the prices by purchasing gold at lower prices and said , &quot; The demand for gold in China is rising compared to that in India , and Chinese investors are playing a big role in this scenario . &quot;
saying that India is traditionally the biggest purch@@ aser of gold , Hr@@ us@@ he@@ w@@ sky said , &quot; I believe that the Government is attempting to manage trade accounts by restricting gold imports but this is not getting much support any further .
people will find a way in this setup , &quot; he explained .
Hr@@ us@@ he@@ w@@ sky advised investors to invest in gold in the long term and expressed his assessment : &quot; gold will continue to serve as a secure savings commodity .
it is sometimes overlooked that the high debt levels of many Western Govern@@ ments are attributable to &apos; lack of discipline &apos; .
governments are trying to reduce their debts by depreci@@ ating the value of their currencies .
this is why gold prices will rise above current levels , &quot; was his evaluation .
&quot; in the long term , gold is improving its ability to reduce market risks &quot;
Marcus Gru@@ b@@ b , investment general manager of the World Gold Council , indicated that gold is a simple , transparent and secure physical entity , and financial markets are getting increasingly complex and volatile , and said , &quot; In the long term , gold is improving instead of deteriorating in terms of its basic developed features and ability to reduce market risks .
portfolios of small quantities of gold - demonstrating improved yield stability - are usually far more durable and they have proved to be better in coping with the uncertainties in the market , &quot; he said .
pointing out that investment in gold has been on the rise steadily over the past 10 years , Gru@@ b@@ b said , &quot; Gold represents less than 1 % of global investments in various entities .
it means that market opportunities are still very significant for the growth of investments in gold .
during this quarter , strong capital inflows in gold bul@@ lion and coins , which increased by 78 % compared to the previous year , is an indication that the investors &apos; interest is protected , &quot; he said .
to support economic growth , India should increase its national gold stocks &quot;
Gru@@ b@@ b responded to the questions on the largest gold markets in India and China by saying that the drop in gold prices in the second quarter encouraged the demand for jewellery , gold bul@@ lion and coins , and this has enhanced the investment appetite of Asian consumers .
Gru@@ b@@ b said that in the above @-@ mentioned period , the demand for gold jewellery increased by 54 % in China and 51 % percent in India .
Gru@@ b@@ b explained that Chinese consumers had an advantage by buying gold at lower prices and selling it when the price has a rising trend , and said , &quot; In terms of jewellery demand , China generally remained silent in the second half of the year .
following the unexpected fall in gold prices in April , there was an increase in demand and jewellery stocks were sold out quickly . &quot;
Gru@@ b@@ b said that in India , apart from restrictions imposed by the Government on gold imports , the Indian Central Bank implemented measures to support the depreci@@ ating value of the rup@@ ee and preventing foreign currency outflows and said : &quot; the nature of gold demand - restricting the retail demand level for gold - looks difficult and hence the demand can be met by un@@ authorized channels .
the World Gold Council believes that in line with the India &apos;s policies , gold should be regarded as a strategic investment commodity .
moreover , in line with long @-@ term policy targets and to support economic growth , it must increase its national gold stocks , &quot; was his evaluation .

Sa@@ met Kar@@ ah@@ asan@@ oÄlu , who was applauded until the end , had the audience unanimously commenting that &quot; he will be an actor sought after in the future &quot; based on his impressive and great performance .
comedy and Drama rolled into one
the subject of the film , which describes the events that took place in the village of Cic@@ ek@@ li@@ dÃ¼z in Trabzon during the coup of September 12 , 1980 , is as follows :
&quot; the father of the leading character of the film , Hikmet , is working in Germany .
Hikmet , going to school during the winter season and engaged as a shepherd during the summer season , dreams of becoming a doctor after completing his education .
however it is not very easy to study when you are working .
the love he has for Zu@@ ley@@ ha , the daughter of the richest family in the village , only makes things all the more difficult .
deciding to disclose to Zu@@ ley@@ ha about his love for her that he suppressed for years with the advice he gets from his friends , Hikmet finds there is a very difficult obstacle for him to sur@@ mount in the form of Zu@@ ley@@ ha &apos;s father Sabri A@@ ga .
Sabri A@@ ga has different plans for his daughter .
meanwhile , the &quot; hill &apos; where people from the surrounding village get together and play matches , is one of his ob@@ sessions and he almost declared war on the villagers from this hill . &quot;
from a short film to a full length ...
at the gala , the film &apos;s screen@@ writer and director , Dr. Ismet Er@@ aydÄ±n said they made the film with a very tight budget :
&quot; our purpose was to shoot a short film when we started .
but the first scenes that they shot attracted such great interest in the social media that we were started feeling motivated about making it a long film and we made it .
when we approached a distribution company in Istanbul , they asked us if we had any popular actors .
I said that we did not have any popular actors , but that we have 86 actors from the Black Sea who you can never find elsewhere . &quot;
the films and TV shows made so far have had plenty of poor quality dial@@ ects used and the Black Sea people were portrayed incorrec@@ tly .
you will see 86 people originally from the Black Sea people in the film a little later .
I tried to shoot a Black Sea film .
I wish that others could have shot a film before I did , in which case we could have watched a comedy film without swear words being used .
if the people from the Black Sea had not been portrayed incorrec@@ tly , I would not have had to shoot the film .
we used Turkish sub@@ titles in a Turkish film for the first time .
this is a first too .
we did it so that the Black Sea dial@@ ect could be understood better .
we put sub@@ titles for the English dialogue in the film to get it translated into the Black Sea dial@@ ect .
whoever the camera focused on happened to be an actor when shooting that film .
&quot; youths of the Hill &quot; is our first film .
there may be mistakes and shortcomings &quot; he said .
do not miss this warm @-@ hear@@ ted film , which blows fresh breath into the Black sea movies .
pay attention when selecting your perf@@ ume
you need to pay attention if you are highly concerned about personal care and if you exagger@@ ate and swing around with the perf@@ ume bottle in your hand .
the perf@@ ume you use may cause skin diseases .
we discussed with der@@ mat@@ ologist Dr. F@@ unda At@@ aman of His@@ ar Inter@@ continental Hospital about Po@@ ikil@@ o@@ der@@ ma of Ci@@ vat@@ te , which is more common in women than men and may be caused by various cosmetic articles , primarily per@@ fu@@ mes .
Po@@ ikil@@ o@@ der@@ ma of Ci@@ vat@@ te is a skin p@@ ig@@ mentation disorder seen on the sides and back of the neck and cle@@ av@@ age ( not the area shadowed by chin ) , Dr. At@@ aman explained , and said , &quot; It occurs primarily in light @-@ sk@@ in@@ ned people depending on their exposure to sun@@ light .
it is manifested as brown and red marks .
the skin becomes thin@@ ner , ve@@ ined and hair roots are more evident .
pul@@ se d@@ ye las@@ er treatment and protection from sun@@ light is one treatment option .
another option is the use of cre@@ ams containing ret@@ ino@@ ic ac@@ id .
these cre@@ ams must be used for a long time .
R@@ edness , dr@@ ying and it@@ ching during use are side effects or an aller@@ gic reaction .
in this case , treatment should continue intermit@@ tently .
since it could be her@@ edi@@ tary , those whose parents have Po@@ ikil@@ o@@ der@@ ma of Ci@@ vat@@ te must be informed about protection and treatment at an early age , &quot; she explained .

the ratio of those contempla@@ ting quitting in one month &apos;s time was 12.@@ 9 percent and those doing so in 12 months &apos; time was 3@@ 5.4 percent .
in the evaluation section of the study the following views were expressed :
&quot; the net result in terms of consumption of tobacco products indicates that the tobacco control laws and the National Tobacco Control Programme and Action Plan in Turkey have been implemented effectively .
in this manner , the number of consumers of tobacco products decreased by 2 millions 200 thousands people from 2008 to 2012 , and the frequency of use reduced by 4.1 percent . significant reduction of the cigarettes consumption took place among price @-@ sensitive consumers such as youngsters and the less @-@ educated section of the population .
according to the report of the World Health Organization published in 2013 on the Global Tobacco Epi@@ demic , Turkey , in terms of tobacco control , achieved a high degree of success and became the first and only country to have met all the criteria .
in the report , other countries were asked to follow the example set by Turkey . &quot;
the ban on smoking in indoor areas continues to have a favourable impact .
the number of cigarettes smoked in the first 6 months this year reduced by 10 percent compared to the same period last year and fell to 41 billion 7@@ 79 million 190 thousand 560 .
this figure was 46 billion 325 million 440 thousand 100 units in the same period in 2012 .

another innovation from Andro@@ id
this patent taken by Google will simplify &apos; sending and receiving files &apos; even further .
by far , Andro@@ id is the leader among mobile operating Systems and Google has been awarded a patent for a new inter@@ face technology that works for those who frequently share files with friends .
the function supports content sharing over wireless technologies such as N@@ FC and Blu@@ et@@ o@@ oth , and in fact , is not very different from Andro@@ id Be@@ am and Apple Air@@ drop .
Google &apos;s latest innovation implements this feature by allowing sending data to groups of users that are nearby instead of single sharing and offers users the ease and comfort of drag and drop .
it is almost certain that this new feature will be a part of new versions of Andro@@ id .

they all go to Imam Hatip !
students studying at normal secondary school became students of the imam Hatip religious secondary school .
the Ministry of Education , following the 4 + 4 + 4 education system , converted all primary schools in Turkey to primary schools , secondary schools and imam Hatip secondary schools last year .
after one year of education , the Ministry converted a large number of schools into imam Hatip schools in line with new &quot; requirements , &quot; and these , as signed by the Ministry have been revealed as a scandal in the course of conver@@ sions .
the conversion scandal may be of interest to all current students at schools that were converted into imam Hatip secondary schools and which surfaced in the course of renewing the registrations at Sek@@ er Sec@@ on@@ dary School in Konya &apos;s Mer@@ am district .
one year of normal secondary school
Sek@@ er Primary School , following the 4 + 4 + 4 system , has been converted into a secondary school at the beginning of last year .
at the school , students in the 3 and 4 grades who will go to another school as required by the system , and those in the 6 , 7 and 8. grades of secondary school had been studying together .
after operating as a normal secondary school for one year , it was converted into imam Hatip secondary school at the end of the 2012 @-@ 2013 academic year .
after being converted into imam Hatip , the school accepted its 5 grade students as &quot; imam Hatip students &quot; for the first time .
however , students who were registered in 5 grade of a normal secondary school last year , and who would have been in the 6 grade this year , have been automatically re @-@ registered as students of an imam Hatip secondary school .
&quot; if you don &apos;t like it , go to another school &quot;
parents who became aware of the situation went to school to complain .
however , the school administration , based on instructions from the Pro@@ vin@@ cial National Education Directorate , said , &quot; Parents who do not want their children to continue at imam Hatip may register at another secondary school . &quot;
the declaration made by Konya Province National Education Directorate contained some interesting expressions .
the declaration said : &quot; by taking the number of students into account and schools with the approval of Konya Govern@@ orship , we have converted some schools again . in this context , 15 @-@ 20 schools in Konya were converted into imam Hatip . &quot;
schools enter the e @-@ school system of the ministry with their school codes .
but when the school is converted into an imam Hatip , its previous school code is dele@@ ted from the system .
a new school code must be assigned and the students must be re @-@ registered .
for not vic@@ tim@@ izing the students and the teachers of the schools with the changed codes , these schools transferred the students to imam Hatip secondary school using the new school code .
parents can transfer their children to another school if they want , &quot; so it was said .

the prosecutor said to the ministry , &quot; Let it be &quot;
a demand made by the Family Ministry was rejected
SE@@ Y@@ MA Ulusoy / Vatan intelligence
at the trial of Abbas Åahin , who killed his wife P@@ Ä±n@@ ar Åahin , 24 , because she filed for divorce , the prosecutor rejected a demand for intervention by the Family Ministry on the grounds that it was not a case of violence .
the victim &apos;s mother , AyÅe Ä°kiz and sister , H@@ edi@@ ye Ä°kiz attended the first hearing of the trial proceedings held at the Fifth Bak@@ ir@@ kÃ¶y Criminal Court of prisoner Abbas Åahin , who murdered his wife P@@ Ä±n@@ ar Åahin .
defendant Abbas Åahin presented a 4 page defence to the court .
in his defence , Mr Åahin said , &quot; My wife wanted my help to make a new beginning .
when we met she asked to rent a house but did not want me to know where the house was .
I lost control and pulled out a gun that I had with me .
at the time my wife was holding on to the steering wheel .
the gun went off when the car sw@@ er@@ ved to the side .
my wife fell on my arm .
I later took her to a poly@@ clinic .
&quot; I regret it , &quot; he said .
if we accept it , they will intervene in every case
&quot; my daughter was 14 when she got married , &quot; said mother AyÅe Ä°kiz .
&quot; he in@@ dul@@ ged in violence on my daughter during the entire time that they were married , &quot; she said and the victim &apos;s sister H@@ edi@@ ye Ä°kiz said that the defendant had kidnapped her sister twice .
following complaints from the mother and the sister , a lawyer for the Ministry of Women and Social Welfare requested that the ministry be allowed to participate in the trial .
describing his opinion to the court about the plea , the court prosecutor TarÄ±k Dursun Ben@@ de@@ z said , &quot; Even though it says in Article 20 of Law 6@@ 2@@ 84 that &quot; A ministry , in case of need , can participate in all kinds of administrative , criminal , li@@ ti@@ gations and contentious jurisdiction involving violence on women , children and family members , &quot; the trial mentioned is not a case of violence but a criminal case , and even the plea is contrary to the equality and gender discrimination clause of Article 10 of the constitution , and if the opinion is not accepted , the Ministry of Women and Social Welfare will want to be associated with every trial involving a woman victim , so we propose that the plea be rejected . &quot;
the court granted the request of the prosecutor .
it was accepted until today
in AÄrÄ± , the Ministry of Women and Social Welfare requested for being allowed to intervene in the trial of a man and his family who murdered his wife Melek Kara@@ aslan .
the court considered the ministry &apos;s request to be justi@@ fiable and granted it .
the Ministry of Women and Social Welfare is involved in the trial of the man who pushed his wife , a teacher named E@@ sin GÃ¼neÅ off a cliff .
in Izmir in October last year , Fatma Åahin , Minister of Women and Social Welfare , pleaded for rigorous life imprisonment at the trial of S.@@ Ã@@ . and 6 relatives who were alleged to have stabbed his wife to death because she wanted a divorce .
the court granted the plea .
in Van , the Ministry of Women and Social Welfare is involved in the trial of Kerem Ãak@@ an , 32 , who has been arrested for stabbing and running his car over his partner Eylem Pes@@ en , 17 , who was six @-@ months pregnant .
