# Instructions

The dataset is in ./data/ directory.
The script preprocess.sh prepares the data as follows:

- tokenize
- truecase
- BPE algorithm (split too long/rare words)

The files we are using: \*.bpe.tr \*.bpe.en and \*.tok.en.
Files:

- corpus - the training dataset
- newsdev2016 - devset
- newstest2016 - testset

Everything is preprocessed but everything is in here, just in case.
